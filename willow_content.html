    <h3>Weeping Willow</h3>
    
    <p>Salix babylonica is a medium- to large-sized deciduous tree, growing up to 20–25 m (66–82 ft) tall. It grows rapidly, but has a short lifespan, between 40 and 75 years.</p>
    
    <p>The shoots are Yellowish-brown, with small buds. The leaves are alternate and spirally arranged, narrow, light green, 4–16 cm (1.6–6.3 in) long and 0.5–2 cm (0.2–0.8 in) broad, with finely serrate margins and long acuminate tips; they turn a gold-yellow in autumn.</p>
