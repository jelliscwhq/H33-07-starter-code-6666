    <h3>Maple</h3>
    
    <p>Maple trees offer some of the best shade around. Not only are they relatively fast-growing, but few trees can compete with the fall color of say an October Glory or Brandywine Maple Tree. </p>
    
    <p>Sugar, Black, and Red maples are the trees that are important for maple syrup production.</p>
